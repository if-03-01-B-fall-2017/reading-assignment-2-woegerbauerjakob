	<br>
	Name the components of a css rule properly<br>
	Selector Declaration(Property Value)<br><br>

	The background-color property specifies the background color of an element.<br><br>
	Pseudo classes for the  <a>  element<br>
	A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.<br>

	Style visited and unvisited links differently<br>

	A text can be left or right aligned, centered, or justified.<br>
	The following example shows center aligned, and left and right aligned text (left alignment is default if text direction is left-to-right, and right alignment is default if text direction is right-to-left):<br>

	CSS Font Families<br>
	In CSS, there are two types of font family names:<br>

	font family - a specific font family (like "Times New Roman" or "Arial")<br>
	Declarations for font families<br>
	In CSS, there are two types of font family names:<br>
	generic family - a group of font families with a similar look (like "Serif" or "Monospace")<br>
	font family - a specific font family (like "Times New Roman" or "Arial")<br><br>
	Declarations for font style normal and italic<br>
	The font-style property is mostly used to specify italic text.<br>
	This property has three values:<br>
	normal - The text is shown normally<br>
	italic - The text is shown in italics<br>
	oblique - The text is "leaning" (oblique is very similar to italic, but less supported)<br><br>
	<br>
	The font-size property sets the size of the text.<br>
	Being able to manage the text size is important in web design. However, you should not use font size adjustments to make paragraphs look like headings, or headings look like paragraphs.<br>
	The font-size value can be an absolute, or relative size.<br>
	Absolute size:<br>
	Sets the text to a specified size<br>
	Does not allow a user to change the text size in all browsers (bad for accessibility reasons)<br>
	Absolute size is useful when the physical size of the output is known<br>
	Relative size:<br>
	Sets the size relative to surrounding elements<br>
	Allows a user to change the text size in browsers<br><br>
	Declarations for font weights<br>
	To allow users to resize the text (in the browser menu), many developers use em instead of pixels.<br>
	The em size unit is recommended by the W3C.<br>
	1em is equal to the current font size. The default text size in browsers is 16px. So, the default size of 1em is 16px.<br>
	The size can be calculated from pixels to em using this formula: pixels/16=em<br>
